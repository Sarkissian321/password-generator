# Secure-Password-Generator
This is a secure random password generator program made to enhance security for sensitive data. This website uses HTML to structure the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to create a functional password generator. 
As a user, one can provide input preferences through a sequence of prompts, specifying criteria such as password length (ranging from 8 to 128 characters) and the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. A secure and random passweord is then generated and displayed on the screen.
